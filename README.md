This somewhat-unruly repository houses all files of my CS251 Software Design Final Project. 
This was a group project between me and a great friend/colleague/teammate named Eliott Cassidy.
We set out to create a from-scratch, completely homemade neural network framework, then we applied it in various ways.

Below is the original deployment instructions we had written back in 2019.


Yo! 

simply running 
"./presentation" 
will compile every program that is worth demonstrating. It will also 
prompt you to enter a number 1-5 that will run one of the programs. 

In terms of content, "Neural_net.{cpp,h}" have the heart of our code.

Luke created "GAN.{h,cpp}" that could hypothetically make some extremely cool
stuff. it is a Generative adversarial network that backpropagates.

Luke also made "Gen_net.{cpp,h}" that gives a framework for a GAN that doesn't
backpropagate, but tries to learn evolutionarily. it doesn't work super well.

Eliott created "connect4.{h,cpp}" that has the code for his AI that plays 
connect 4.
